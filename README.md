This is an implementation code of the probalistic principal component analysis using different technique:
- Maximum Likehood
- Expectation Maximization 
- Bayesian Variatonal 

The different techniques applied above are described by C.Bishop in his book Pattern Recognition Machine Learning.
The Bayesian approach described exhaustively in the [article](https://digital-library.theiet.org/content/conferences/10.1049/cp_19991160)(9th International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks: ICANN '99) written by the same author.

An other implementation of ppca for missing values case described in this [article](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00321476/en) (J.Verbek) is also implemented.
